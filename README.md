Programming problems in mojo


Issues:

If running mojo in ubuntu complains with message like no suitable compiler found etc, run thefollowing command:

sudo apt update 
sudo apt install -y build-essential

We, might need to run the following commands too:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libtinfo-dev
