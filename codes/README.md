### How to use the `docgen` command

#### Example usage:

Run the following command from the `codes` folder. It will generate docs/[mojo_code_file].md and update docs/index.md

```bash
./generate_docs linkedlist.mojo

```
> **Note**: `docgen` expects two comments at the start of the .mojo file that start with `###`. The first is for the title in the index.md and secod is for the description in the same index.md file.
